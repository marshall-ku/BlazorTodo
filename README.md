![result](https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/HEaKg/btrqysYEM9i/B8cGPHlKAn1VeHBJXmaUoK/img.gif)

I just built this to see how blazor works, and how to write codes with c#.

Reference: [Build a Blazor todo list app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/build-a-blazor-app?view=aspnetcore-6.0&pivots=webassembly)

## Tasks

-   [x] Add Item (From reference)
-   [x] Remove Item
-   [ ] Save / Load list to local storage
    -   [x] Save list
    -   [ ] Load list
    -   Tried with [Blazored LocalStorage](https://github.com/Blazored/LocalStorage), and failed to parse string.
